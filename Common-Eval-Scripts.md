**Please remember that the eval command is potentially dangerous; it is locked to the bot owner, but _never_ run a script unless you know what it does!**

The following are examples of scripts that can be run via the eval command (bot owner only). If your bot's prefix is set to `!!` and you've enabled the eval command, an eval (such as the first one listed below) is run like `!!eval jda.guilds`

### List all servers that the bot is on
```js
jda.guilds
```

### Leave a specific server
```js
jda.getGuildById("GUILDIDHERE").leave().queue()
```
