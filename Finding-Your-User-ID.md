This page describes how to find your unique User ID. Any of these methods work, and you only need to do one of them.

## Method 1
1. Enter text as if you are going to mention (ping) yourself. (Make sure that you are mentioning yourself and no one else)<br>![Mention](http://i.imgur.com/ZyLoGkL.png)
2. Insert a backslash (`\`) before the mention<br>![Backslash](http://i.imgur.com/35KX2Lm.png)
3. Send the message. What will appear is your ID surrounded by `<@` or `<@!` on the left and `>` on the right (the message should be highlighted)<br>![ID](http://i.imgur.com/d0NwAzR.png)
