# Setup
1. Download the zip above, and unzip it
2. In command prompt, [navigate](https://www.google.com/#q=how+to+navigate+in+cmd+prompt) to the directory with _SpectraMusic.jar_
3. Enter the command `java -jar SpectraMusic.jar`
4. A config file has been generated. Go [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create) to create a bot application (you'll need the token).
5. Fill in the config with the bot token and _your_ discord ID (you can find this using a bot or typing `\@yourname` in chat; it's a 17 or 18 digit number)
6. If possible, add a [Youtube API Key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard) for drastically faster searches
7. Add the bot to your server. From the bot application page (where you got the token), find the Client ID and insert it in this link, replacing APP_ID: `â€‹https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APP_ID&scope=bot`
8. Run the bot!
